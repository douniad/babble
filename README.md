## Summary

Everyone gets stressed dealing with everyday life and it's easy for mundane things to slip your mind. But when children are involved, that cannot happen. With babble, caregivers and parents are on the same page (quite literally). By sharing one account, everyone is able to stay on top of everything. Start by adding the child(ren) to the childboard and keep each other up to date by posting updates.

Happy babbling!
